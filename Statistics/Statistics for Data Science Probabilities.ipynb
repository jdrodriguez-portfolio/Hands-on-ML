    "1. Lets say we have a fair coin that we are going to toss so both possible outcomes are that the coin lands as heads or tails so the resulting sample space $\\Omega$ would be the combination of both outcomes $\\omega_1 = H$ and $\\omega_2 = T$  \n",

Lets say we have a fair coin but now we throw it twice, this changes the situation now we have not only more outcomes but every outcome has two values one for each throw so we now have  $\\omega_1 = HH$, $\\omega_2 = HT$, $\\omega_3 = TH$ and $\\omega_4 = TT$ and the combination of all outcomes result in: \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "3. Let $\\omega$ be the outcome of a measurement of some physical quantity, for example, temperature. Then $\\Omega = \\mathbb{R} = \\{-\\infty,\\infty\\}$. One could argue that taking $\\Omega$ is not accurate since temperature has a lower bound but there is no harm in taking the sample space to be larger than needed. Specify an event A that contains all outcomes over or equal to 10 and lower than 50\n",
